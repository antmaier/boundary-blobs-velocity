Inference of the radial and poloidal velocity of the blobs in  scrape-off layer from Gas Puff Imaging

This is my 2021 fall semester project at EPFL. It analyzes the dynamics of blobs, regions of enhanced density in the plasma, in the scrape-off layer of the EPFL Tokamak Ã  Configuration Variable (TCV).
The data analysis and visualization has been made with MATLAB. 
Please read the report for more info about this project.
